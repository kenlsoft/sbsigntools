======================================================================

  - This repo fixes build errors when build with gnu tools. Other
    toolchains are not tested.
  - After clone, use 'git submodule update --init' to get submodule
    ccan. The original submodule pointing to git.linux.org might not
    be cloned successfully, hence we uses github url instead.
    Also, a forked version exists under my github space.
  - Then use autogen.sh and configure and make to build it. Please
    install dependencies when configure error reported.
